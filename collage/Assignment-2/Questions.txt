Implement Decision Tree on the Given Dataset.
You have to implement the Decision tree classification problem on the given dataset. The instructions are as followed:

1) Import required libraries
2) Read the data
3) Show basic overview of the data like head, target, or any missing values
4) Handle the missing values if any
5) Perform all basic EDA including all types of plots to show relation between features
6) Divide the dataset into dependent and independent ( feature selection)
7) Split data into train and test
8) Build the DT
9) Evaluate the model
10) Visualize the DT
11) Optimize the DT using other criterion like entropy for Information Gain (default is gini index)
12) Build and visualize the DT again using the new criterion
13) Find the model performance ( plot the confusion matrix and find the precision, recall, and fscore)
